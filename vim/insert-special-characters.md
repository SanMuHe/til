# Insert Special Characters

To enter "special" characters such as the euro or copyright symbols, or diacritical marks such as the German umlaut or accent grave, `digraphs` can be used. Digraphs work by pressing CTRL-K and a two-letter combination while in insert mode. For example, in insert mode type:
```
CTRL-K a:
CTRL-K e>
```
to give `ä` and `ê`. 

Another good place to use `digraphs` is when setting `listcharts` as mentioned in [Make Space and Tab Visible](make-space-and-tab-visible.md).
