# Beginning And End Of Previous Change

You can jump to the beginning of the previous change with the `[` mark by
hitting `'[` from normal mode. Similarly, you can jump to the end of the
previous change with the `]` mark by hitting `']`.

Text that was just pasted is also considered a change. Thus, hitting `'[`
and `']` will jump to the beginning and end, respectively, of the text that
was just pasted into the buffer.

See `:h '[` and `:h ']` for more details.
